CAMPAIGN

name: "Operation Nightfall"

desc:
   "Two Force:Space fleets press on through major population centers on the "
   "road to the Marakan homeworld. Civilians back home begin to question "
   "the Alliance's involvement in the war, even as shadows fall upon the "
   "climactic battle."

situation:
   "\tOperation Firestorm was not the strategic success we once believed it to be. "
   "Force:Intel field agents have been unable to recover either the Borovan Archaelith "
   "or any of the illegal technite from the Korian and Kolchev systems.  We have now "
   "determined that the technite has already been shipped "
   "out of Kolchev to the Garrison system, and we believe that the Archaelith cannot "
   "be far behind.  Garrison is a major military stronghold for the Hegemony, close to the Marak system "
   "itself. We cannot estimate how long we have before the Hegemony will be able to produce "
   "a Quantum Disruptor weapon system.\n\n"

   "\tWe are therefore commencing Operation Nightfall to recover the artifacts from the "
   "Garrison system. Our first task is to gain military control of the Radix and Isham star "
   "systems. Force First Fleet will take the northern route and secure the Isham system, "
   "while Second Fleet holds their southern flank by controlling the Radix system. "
   "Our combined forces will then converge on the Garrison system as soon as they can manage it.\n"

orders:
   "\t* First Fleet: Engage military targets in the Isham system.\n"
   "\t* Second Fleet: Secure the Radix system.\n"
   "\t* Both fleets to converge on the Garrison system as soon as possible.\n"
