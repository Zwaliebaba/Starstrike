         message: "I don't have very much time.  I had to leave Jarnell in a hurry, can't say where I am or where I'm going.  People started disappearing from the Ele'aan Consulate a week ago.  One at a time, they just... weren't there anymore.  I figured I'd better disappear myself, while I still had the chance to decide how and when.  I don't know what is going to happen, or when I'll see you again.  Or even if I'll see you again.\n\nI don't think I can trust Jonas anymore, or I'd go find him.  But I had to tell someone, and I figured you might at least understand.  Might at least try to do something without letting them trace the information back to me...\n\nThis whole war has been a sham from the beginning.  The Zolons and Hegemony don't have the Borovan Archaelith - they never did.  I took it from the museum myself the night the museum was destroyed.  That was the real reason the Ele'aan Fusion went to the Borovan System - to get to the Archaelith first, before it could fall into Zolon hands.\n\nThe next day, I gave it to Councilor Auris and he took it with him back to Ele'aas.  I can't understand why President Valmar would claim that the Fusion backed up his reasons for pursuing this conflict.  We can't need the Marakan border worlds that badly, and I can't see a reason why he would want to stir up trouble with the Zolon Empire.\n\n
I don't have very much time.  I could be discovered at any moment.  I need to keep moving.  Promise me you'll stay safe, OK?\n\nLove from\nSara" }
