TELMERA CITY, SOLUS - An attempted palace coup by Dantari agents was thwarted
by alert members of the Provisional Security Directorate early this morning. 
Separatist agents, working from a secret base near the capitol offices, succeeded
in destroying the executive suite of the presidential palace.

Security service members discovered the bomb only moments before it was detonated
and were able to escort President Marish and his party to an undisclosed safe
location.  Senators Hamil and Covanon who were to attend a working breakfast with
the President were killed in the blast, as were two security service agents who
died trying to protect them.  Memorial services for all four men are planned for
later in the week.

Speaking on behalf of President Marish, executive spokesperson Cyn Talban affirmed
that the central government had not been struck down by the terrorist-style attack.  
"We are still very much open for business.  President Marish is meeting with security
advisors at this hour, and he will be holding a press conference from the safehouse
later this morning to address your questions and concerns."
