CAMPAIGN

name: "Operation Shining Fortress"

desc:
   "The war begins. Hegemony forces have begun to invade the core "
   "Alliance systems.  Starfleets from Loris and Kolchev, moving "
   "through the independent systems Silessia and Haiche, have attacked "
   "key targets in the Janus and Borovan systems.  The Alliance Fourth "
   "and Fifth Fleets are fighting a defensive battle trying to halt "
   "the Hegemony advance, evacuate civilians, and form an effective "
   "counterattack."

situation:
   "\tThe Terellian Alliance is facing the first true interstellar "
   "war in nearly five hundred years.  Hegemony forces have begun to invade the core "
   "Alliance systems.  Starfleets from Loris and Kolchev, moving "
   "through the independent systems Silessia and Haiche, have attacked "
   "key targets in the Janus and Borovan systems.\n\n"

   "\tForce:Space Fourth Fleet (Titan) is stationed in the Borovan "
   "system, and is deploying in a defensive posture to meet the invasion "
   "threat. Fifth Fleet (Hyperion) is divided.  Task force TF5.15 is "
   "assigned to the Janus proving grounds for training exercises.  "
   "The remainder of Fifth Fleet is spread throughout the Athenar system."

orders:
   "\t* Protect Alliance civilians and assets in Janus and Borova.\n"
   "\t* Evacuate civilians and government personnel as necessary.\n"
   "\t* Stop the Hegemony advance until a counterattack can be mounted.\n"
