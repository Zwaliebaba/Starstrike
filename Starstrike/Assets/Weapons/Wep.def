   description:      "The ALPHA CANNON is the high-energy particle weapon in use on most Hegemony fighter craft. Analysts believe that this weapon is nearing end-of-life phase out, but remains in service because it is cheap and reliable.  The Alpha Cannon tends to be low in effective damage and penetration, but makes up for those limitations with a high refire rate."

The Delta Cannon has improved focus and high bolt velocity that contribute to its accuracy at ranges up to 10 km."

The Heavy is a slimmed down version of the retired 'Chain Lightning' cannon used on early model LCAs for mine sweeping and antiship warfare.  This is the first time a weapon of this caliber has been fitted on a single seat fighter.  The Heavy is too slow and unweildy to be effective against maneuvering fighters, but the high damage potential makes this weapon a first-rate ship killer."
